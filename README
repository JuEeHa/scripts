The most useful of my scripts in ~/bin, use at your own risk.
Most scripts are unmodified, however some have been changed to work with graphical environment.

	alert.sh HH:MM "cmd"
Executes specified cmd when system clock gets HH:MM

	amdtbl.awk <infile >outfile
A table extension for Markdown, a fixed version of awk implementation at http://repo.cat-v.org/amdtbl/

	aytdl yturl fname.mp3

NOTE: you should execute it on a RAM-based fs

	BUP=bupname bup.sh file0 file1 ... fileN
Backups stuff to hardcoded dir, change if you want to use.

	clipb.sh [a] [. text]
If no arguments are specified, it opens `~/.clipbored`, a "extension of clipboard" file. If "a" is specified, it first does `cat >> ~/.clipbored`. If "." is specified it appends all arguments to .clipbored

	codetodo.sh [dir0 dir1 ... dirN]
Extracts todo messages in form of "/* TODO: foo */" (.c and .h) or "# TODO: foo" (.sh) out of code files in either specified directories or current directory.

	fbb url0 url1 ... urlN
Opens specified urls, in order.
Browser used is specified in $BROWSER with arguments specified in $BROWSER_ARGS. If not set, the ones specified in ~/.fbb are used.
NOTE: See vidplay for notes about the config file
NOTE: If $BROWSER and $BROWSER_ARGS are still unset, fbb defaults to `BROWSER=links BROWSER_ARGS=-g`

	genpasswd
Generates a nice throwaway password

	git-commit.sh Commit message
	branch=gitbranch git-commit.sh Commit message
A hacky script that commits all changes in dir, then pushes either $branch or master

	install-btw [VERSION]

	mothball.sh dir

NOTE: hardcoded paths

	vidplay vid0 vid1 ... vidN
Plays videos.
The video player used is the one specified in $VIDPLAYER. If it is not set, the one specified in ~/.vidplay is used. If that is also unset, mplayer is used. Player arguments may be set using VIDPLAYER_ARGS in the same manner as VIDPLAYER
NOTE: Settings in ~/.vidplay take precedence over the environment; ~/.vidplay is actually a shell script, so you can use 'test -z "$VAR" && VAR=value.
NOTE: If $VIDPLAYER and $VIDPLAYER_ARGS are still unset, vidplay defaults to `VIDPLAYER=mplayer VIDPLAYER_ARGS="-vo $MPVO -framedrop"` (MPVO=gl by default)
